- 👋 Hi, I’m @anajadelis
- 👀 I’m interested in bascially anything related to Web Design and IOS developing, along with photo modification, graphic design and music production!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift, Java, JavaScript and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Swift-based apps, not only on the graphic part, but also on creating sound themes for games or anything music related.
